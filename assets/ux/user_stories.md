# User-Stories

* As a user I am presented with a series of different colored buttons, a level counter reading zero and 2 buttons to start the game.
* When I start the game, the counter increments by 1 and a random button lights up at the same time playing a sound.
* When I click on the button that lit up, the counter increments by 1 and that button lights up and plays its sound again followed by another random button.
* Each time I get the pattern of buttons right, the counter goes up by 1 and the pattern repeats with an added random button.
* When I make a mistake, the game informs me of it and the whole pattern repeats, allowing me to try again.
* When I make a mistake 3 times during the same round, the game informs me that i lost, the level counter goes down to 1 and a new pattern begins starting with a single lit up button.
* When I get the pattern right for 20 levels, I'm informed I won the game and can start it again with a new pattern.
* When I start the game in strict mode, I am not allowed a single mistake. Once a mistake is made, the game resets and starts with a new pattern.
